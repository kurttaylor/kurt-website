abstract: 'Congenital anomalies (CAs) are structural or functional disorders that occur during intrauterine life. Longitudinal cohort studies provide unique opportunities to investigate potential causes and consequences of these disorders. In this data note, we describe how we identified cases of major CAs, with a specific focus on congenital heart diseases (CHDs), in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We demonstrate that combining multiple sources of data including data from antenatal, delivery, primary and secondary health records, and parent-reported information can improve case ascertainment. Our approach identified 590 participants with a CA according to the Euro Registers of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) guidelines, 127 of whom had a CHD. We describe the methods that identified these cases and provide statistics on subtypes of anomalies. The data note contains details on the processes required for researchers to access these data.'
