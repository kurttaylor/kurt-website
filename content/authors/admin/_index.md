I am a PhD student at the University of Bristol based in the Integrative Epidemiolgoy Unit. I am in my final year of his 4-year PhD Studentship, funded by the British Heart Foundation. My thesis involves using a range of epidemiological techniques to explore maternal lifestyle and molecular risk factors for offspring congenital heart diseases. In my spare time, I am a competitive distance runner and keen cyclist.
