I am a competitive distance runner competing for Bristol & West AC where I am also an acting committee member. My personal bests are listed on my [Power of 10](https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=692848) profile. I train with and help run [Bristol Track Club](https://www.bristoltrackclub.com); a group that was setup to improve the quality of distance running in Bristol and surrounding areas. I also help manage and organise [The South West PB Series](https://www.facebook.com/South-West-PB-Series-104613225088774); a series of road races that take place at Odd Down, Bath.
